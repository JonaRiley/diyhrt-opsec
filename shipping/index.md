# Shipping

Customs inspection is found in most, if not all countries. International mail goes through two customs inspection facilities, one from the country of origin, and another in destination country. International mail is subject to far more eyes and inspection (including unwarranted opening and x-raying, depending on a country's laws and common practices) than is domestic mail which merely goes through sorting facilities. In the USA, all domestic First-Class mail is protected by law against unwarranted search and seizure.

International mail is also more expensive, and has higher loss rates than domestic mail. Certain countries are known for having particularly strict customs inspections on incoming mail, including Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and many Middle Eastern and Asian countries. Ordering certain items via international mail to and from these countries is up to the buyer, but generally has an elevated risk of detection and arrest.

## My package is damaged

Sometimes packages damaged a bit while not being completely opened. Remember that those boxes get thrown around a lot, it's possible that it was tossed onto the ground, bent, manhandled by workers or torn by sorting machines. Nevertheless if someone could see the content of your mail through the holes you should not order for a while. If the item could not be seen, because of a visual barrier and/or a decoy the vendor used, you will most likely be fine even if your mail was delivered damaged.

## Can I order to my university or dorm?

Only if you haven't signed away any rights to your school allowing them to search your mail, and always remember that hehe university does not need any probable cause to search your dorm. 

## Should I check tracking?

Do not check tracking at all, unless a substantial or abnormal amount of time has passed without delivery (see the below section). You will only leave traces, be patient. If you absolutely have to check it (which should be never), do not use Tor or Tails to do it. It's a huge red flag, completely ruins your anonymity (tracking numbers are linked to your address) and compromises your plausible deniability. Instead, use a third party website like TrackingEx or PackageMapping. Do not use your own WiFi for checking the tracking number. Use one that is not tied to your identity (like a cafe) or use a VPN and choose a server that is in the same area as you to not raise any red flags.

## Can I use a fake name?

**NO.** Any malicious party can send you illegal items but using a fake name indicates an intent to deceive. If the police have your address, they definitely have your name. Concealing your name from vendors is useless as you're sending them your address anyway. You want your packages to blend in with the normal deliveries you receive. 

## Should I sign for a package?

Yes. If a controlled delivery happens, you're going to be arrested anyway, just sign for the package. This is not an admission of guilt. 

## What courier should I use?

Do your best to use USPS, since they're a federal entity and they can't open your packages without a warrant. [UPS](https://www.ups.com/media/en/terms_service_gnd_pr.pdf) and [FedEx](http://www.fedex.com/cr_english/services/terms.html) reserve the right to open and inspect your packages any time they want to (and often do). 

## Controlled deliveries

This is an attempt to accept a package containing drugs to obtain a solid reason for a search of your home to be conducted. They get you to accept the package, which they use as reasonable cause to believe you ordered the package and knew it was coming. Just because a package requires a signature does not mean it is a CD.

#### How do people get CD'ed?

They may order a bulk amount of product from abroad, or LE may have noticed an influx of packages from the same person and inspect one and profile you for a while. You are more likely to get CD’ed when ordering large amounts from another country. Domestic packages of a smaller quantity are very unlikely to get caught, and if it's a personal amount, you will more likely get a love letter and that will be the end of it. They may start monitoring your mail.

#### What happens in a CD?

LE will try and deliver a package containing illicit items to you as you would normally receive them. Nothing will look out of the ordinary. They will get you to accept the package, and they will come out of hiding, announce their presence and give you instructions on what they want you to do. You're fucked. 

#### How can I protect myself from a CD?

This guide! Your address is one of the safest places to order to. Always use your real name and address if you can, it’s less suspicious. You will still get CD’ed if you're ordering to a vacant house or a PO box. One of the most important things to do if you suspect a CD is to **clean your house**. Get rid of all illegal and suspicious items too (injection supplies). If they do not find anything in the search, it's hard to convict you as long as you maintain plausible deniability. Since you used Tails there's no evidence of your orders and a CD does not mean you are going to get any sort of punishment, they have to find solid evidence that you ordered the package.

#### Can I sign for a controlled delivery and then dispose of the items?

Probably not.

## Love letters

A "love letter" is just a playful name for the letter that the Post Office/Postal Inspector/LEO sends you that basically says "We seized your items but we don't have the time or resources to build a case on you". 

#### International seizure letters 

Customs agencies around the world, including US Customs, frequently send “love letter” seizure notices to recipients of international mail with small amounts of suspected illegal items inside. These seizure letters are usually real.

When you get one of these, consider that address burnt. Never use it again as a delivery address. PSA: US Customs keeps a record of all seized packages that were going to your address.

#### Domestic seizure letters 

It is very, very uncommon to get a domestic seizure notice for seized items sent through domestic mail. The usual protocol is to conduct a controlled delivery and arrest the intended recipient. Normally any seizure notices of this kind are clever scams by unscrupulous vendors, trying to avoid tanking their reputation. This applies especially in the USA where, 99% of the time, any seizure letter you receive for a domestic order is completely fake. The only time US Postal Inspectors send seizure letters for domestic items is when they have seized cash.
