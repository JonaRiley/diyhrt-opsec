- No fiat! Use Monero or one-time Bitcoin wallets. Wallets that require verification should be considered lost. Cashapp is not a secure wallet.
- Buy Monero from https://kycnot.me/search?q=&type=exchange&xmr=on. If you need to use bitcoin, create the wallet on your TAILS instance, convert Monero to BTC and let the bitcoin wallet die when you unplug the USB.
- You should sign for packages. This is not an admission of guilt and if you get a controlled delivery, you will be arrested regardless. Signing for packages is standard procedure, especially for international packages. 
- Use Tails. It takes an hour to install and only needs an 8GB USB drive. Only using Tor Browser is not considered safe for making purchases. This CANNOT use a virtual machine. Don't be lazy, you will pay for it
- You should treat this like you're buying crystal meth. It WILL be heavily regulated in the future and it's not very smart to assume otherwise.
