- No fiat! Use Monero or one-time Bitcoin wallets. Wallets that require verification should be considered lost. Cashapp is not a secure wallet.
- Buy Monero from https://kycnot.me/search?q=&type=exchange&xmr=on. If you need to use bitcoin, create the wallet on your TAILS instance, convert Monero to BTC and let the bitcoin wallet die when you unplug the USB.
- Do not sign for packages. This is an admission of guilt, simply say you didn't order it and eat the loss.
- Use Tails. It takes 30 minutes to install and only needs an 8GB USB drive. Only using Tor Browser is not considered safe for making purchases. This CANNOT be completed on Windows and you cannot use a virtual machine.
- You should treat this like you're buying crystal meth. It WILL be heavily regulated in the future and it's silly to assume otherwise.
