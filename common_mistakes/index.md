# Common mistakes

There are a lot of things that could go wrong when you buy this stuff online. Here's a list of common mistakes and how to avoid them:

- High quantities. You shouldn't purchase a lot in the same order. Wait until your first order arrives, then place another
- Signing under a fake name. If the authorities have your address, they most definitely have your name, no need to lie. This raises too many red flags, you will just have to trust the sender to properly conceal your name and address if they get caught. 
- Using PayPal / CashApp / credit cards. Always use Monero or one-time burner Bitcoin wallets. If your vendor doesn't accept crypto, find a new vendor. 
- Speaking to the police. If you followed this properly, there will be no evidence of any wrong-doing and you will not go to jail. Ask for a lawyer the moment you're arrested and do not say a word to the police. 
- Always have a 'clean' house when you're expecting a delivery. If you do get a CD, you can maintain your plausible deniability in the event that you get searched.
